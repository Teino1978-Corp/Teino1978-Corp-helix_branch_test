#Git branches from branches

##This repository is a test of git branching. The purpose is to see if one can branch from a branch, and if this functionality is limited to a specific amount.



### branch_from_branch_from_first_branch:

* The last branch that should branch off the "branch_from_first_branch" branch. I know, I should have named these better.
