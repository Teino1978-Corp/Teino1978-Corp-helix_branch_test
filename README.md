#Git branches from branches

##This repository is a test of git branching. The purpose is to see if one can branch from a branch, and if this functionality is limited to a specific amount.

###branch_from_first_branch:
* This paragraph was committed to the branch called "branch_from_first_branch". If all goes to plan, this should be a branch from "first_branch" and not a branch from "master".
